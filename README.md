# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions:A function that is called in another function is called callback function.

	* Closure:A closure is an  inner fuction that has access to outer function's variables.The closure has three scope chains.1.It has access to the scope variables means variables defined between curly brackets itself. 2.It has access to the outer function's varisbles and it has access to the global variables.

	* `arguments`: In Java Script  we have the built in facility called arguments object  which contains array of the arguments used when the function is called i.e. invoked.

	* Recursion : Recursion is a programming technique by having a function call itself repeatedly until it gets a particular result.

	* `prototype`:  Javascript function has one construct called objects,when it comes to inheritance. Each object has a private property  which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain.

	* Constructors : In javascript a special method is used for creating and initializing an object which is created within a class is called Constructor method.A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of a parent class.If we do not specify the constructor name ,a default constructor is used.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status 	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
